# Demo Puppet WebLogic implementation

This repo contains a demonstration of a Oracle Fusion SOA suite installation. It's purpose is to help you guide through an initial installation of an Oracle SOA node with Puppet. This demo is ready for Puppet 4 and for Puppet 5.

## Starting the nodes masterless

All nodes are available to test with Puppet masterless. To do so, add `ml-` for the name when using vagrant:

The RCU is required to run before any Fusion middleware applications can be installed. Start it first by:
```
$ vagrant up ml-rcudb
```

The choose version of the SOA suite to provision and start with the first node, the admin server.
```
$ vagrant up ml-soa<version>n1
```

When succesful, provision the second node, the SOA node.

```
$ vagrant up ml-soa<version>n2
```

This dem support's WebLogic and SOA suite versions:
- 12.2.1.3
- 12.2.1.4

## Staring the nodes with PE

You can also test with a Puppet Enterprise server. To do so, add `pe-` for the name when using vagrant:

```
$ vagrant up pe-wlsmaster
$ vagrant up pe-wls1
```

## ordering

To succesfully run a SOA suite, You must have a database server for the Reprository (RCU). This demo contains a database server on node rcudb. You must always start this node first. You must always use the specified order:

1. wlmaster (When using PE)
2. rcu
3. soa<version>n1
4. soa<version>n2
